# acoustic-param-from-wav-IR
Webapp for room acoustic analysis from impulse response measurements. Calculates T20, T30, EDT clarity metrics (C50, C80, D50, D80) across octave bands. Implements algorithm matching MATLAB AARAE with threshold-based IR detection, Chu noise compensation, and Schroeder EDC. Built with Streamlit for easy deployment no installation needed for users.
